                <p className="text-lg">
                    This project is a web-based parking management system built with Next.js (React-based) and TypeScript. It assigns parking slots
                    based on vehicle size and entry point, tracks entries and exits, and calculates parking fees following business rules.
                    I also explored the shadcn/ui component library for the first time to build a clean, reusable interface.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    Working on this project made me realize the importance of good state management. It also encouraged me
                    to explore state management libraries such as Zustand to handle more complex use cases in the future.
