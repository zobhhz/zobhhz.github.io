                        I was part of a team of design interns focused on creating UI designs based on user flows provided by business analysts.
                        Our work covered both mobile and desktop interfaces across three main projects:

                        <li>A Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS) focused on payroll features</li>

                        <li>A Retail Inventory System</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="text-lg">
                        This internship was my first experience working with an established design system, which included following brand
                        guidelines, a defined color palette, and applying an 8-point pixel grid for layout consistency. It taught me how to
                        design within constraints while still solving user needs and maintaining usability across different screen sizes.
